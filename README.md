# PlayerFinder: Using Machine Learning (Clustering) to Identify Similar Players to Kevin De Bruyne in English Premier League




## Description
Our Idea is to run a clustering model on a dataset to find out players with similar playing style as Kevin DeBruyne. Kevin has an exceptional record in the premier league. This year also he's having a very good season so far. My idea is to find players who are similar to KDB and visualize the entire process in this notebook.
## Notice
